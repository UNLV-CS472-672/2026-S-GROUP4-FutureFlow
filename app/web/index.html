<!-- This is the main HTML file for the FutureFlow web application. 
It sets up the basic structure of the webpage and includes a div with the id "root" 
where our React application will be rendered. The script tag at the bottom loads our 
main TypeScript file (index.tsx) which contains the entry point for our React application. 
The meta tags in the head section ensure that our webpage is properly displayed on different devices and screen sizes. -->
